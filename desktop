= Console-Based Tools =

These tools are very commonly used by people who drop into a console shell to do some work.

 * bc
 * dc
 * mkisofs
 * cdrecord
 * cdparanoia
 * dvd+rw-tools
 * screen
 * lftp
 * slocate              # tool to index user files
 * zip
 * unzip                # also used for .zip support in file-roller

= Network Services =

Basic network services and Windows integration.

 * smbclient           # to access files on other SAMBA and Windows servers
 * wvdial              # for automatic dialup configuration via g-s-t

These packages help with system integration

 * libsasl2-modules    # allows integration with MTA and login system

= Printing =

Printing and printer configuration is a real weak spot in Debian, and in Linux in general. We will need to stay at the front of the curve here.

 * cupsys                       # our preferred printer management infrastructure
 * cupsys-bsd                   # gives us lpc, lpq, lpr, lprm
 * cupsys-client                # gives us cancel, cupstestppd, lp, lpoptions, lppasswd, lpstat, cupsaddsmb, accept, lpadmin, lpinfo, lpmove
 * foomatic-db-engine           # integrate the foomatic printer driver engine
 * foomatic-db                  # the foomatic printer driver database
 * foomatic-filters             # converter from postscript to printer-specific formats
 * foomatic-db-hpijs            # printer drivers from the hp inkjet project
 * cupsys-driver-gutenprint     # a ton of cupsys ppds, for real comprehensive printer support
 * pnm2ppa                      # several ppds require this
 * gs-esp			# some ppds require this, in place of standard gs
 * hplip     			# support for HP all-in-one printers
 * min12xxw			# support for KonicaMinolta PagePro 1200W, 1300W printers
 * foo2zjs			# Support for printing to ZjStream-based printers

= GUI infrastructure =

 * xterm                         # Provide a backup terminal and complete X env.

Themes: we will ship only the very best looking themes. We won't ship everything that Debian ships, just a custom package that includes the themes we want. These packages are included for size guidance until we have Ubuntu-specific packages.

 * gnome-themes
 * gtk2-engines			# DanielHolbach (gtk2-engines were merged into one package)
 * ubuntu-artwork
 * ubuntu-sounds
 * tangerine-icon-theme		# DanielHolbach (Mark's request)
 * tango-icon-theme		# DanielHolbach (Mark's request, if Tangerine is good enough, maybe we can drop it out)
 * tango-icon-theme-common	# DanielHolbach: split off of tangerine-icon-theme, so people from Xubuntu can use it too.

The gstreamer0.10 packages we want to install:

 * gstreamer0.10-alsa
 * gstreamer0.10-esd
 * gstreamer0.10-plugins-base-apps

Accessibility tools:

 * gnome-accessibility-themes
 * gnome-mag
 * gnome-orca

Python is a significant commitment, we will present Python wherever we can.

Python Integrated Applications:

Documentation:

= Development =

Here we provide a minimal development environment sufficient to build kernel
drivers, so that this is possible on the live CD and in scenarios where
it is problematic to get these packages onto the installed system in order
to compile a driver. -mdz
