 * nis                 # allows Kickstart to configure NIS
 * ltsp-server-standalone [amd64 hppa i386 ia64 sparc] # for LTSP-on-install
 * ltsp-client [amd64 hppa i386 ia64 sparc]            # for LTSP-on-install
 * ldm [amd64 hppa i386 ia64 sparc] # seeded because its not a hard dependency of ltsp-client anymore
