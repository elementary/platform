This seed provides the basic components that should be installed on an
Ubuntu-family desktop system. It is expected to be supplemented with a
particular flavour of desktop environment (e.g. GNOME, KDE, or XFCE).

Before packages are added here, they must follow the procedure to
ensure that all parties are aware of the addition:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeedManagement/AddingPackagesToDesktopCommon

= Hardware and Architecture Support =

== Architecture-independent ==

 * alsa-base # needed for proper hardware detection (hotplug/blacklist.d, modprobe.d)
 * alsa-utils           # basic audio support and mixer level handling
 * (pcmciautils)        # PCMCIA support for >= 2.6.13-rc1 kernels
 * inputattach          # needed for serial mice
 * ubuntu-drivers-common # Make it harder to remove detection support, LP#704597
 * libu2f-udev          # needed to get U2F and yubikeys to work properly

Power management:

 * (acpi-support)

Bluetooth:
TODO not for Xubuntu

 * (bluez) # base for bluetooth support
 * (bluez-cups)  # allow connecting to bluetooth printers from CUPS

== armel ==

 * apmd [armel]

== ppc32, ppc64 ==

 * pbbuttonsd [powerpc]

= Console-Based Tools =

These tools are very commonly used by people who drop into a console shell to do some work.

 * bc
 * zip
 * unzip                # also used for .zip support in file-roller

= Network Services =

Basic network services and Windows integration.

 * wireless-tools
 * rfkill              # No longer using the copy from wireless-tools (LP: #715309)
 * wpasupplicant  # ScottJamesRemnant
 * (libnss-mdns)       # IPv4 link-local DNS support
 * ca-certificates     # common SSL certificates

These packages help with system integration

 * libsasl2-modules    # allows integration with MTA and login system
 * (avahi-daemon)      # some people do not like it, and it is not essential

= Printing =

Printing and printer configuration is a real weak spot in Debian, and in Linux in general. We will need to stay at the front of the curve here.

 * (cups)                     # our preferred printer management infrastructure
 * (cups-bsd)                 # gives us lpc, lpq, lpr, lprm
 * (cups-client)              # gives us cancel, cupstestppd, lp, lpoptions, lppasswd, lpstat, cupsaddsmb, accept, lpadmin, lpinfo, lpmove
 * foomatic-db-compressed-ppds  # the foomatic printer driver database
 * (cups-filters)
 * openprinting-ppds            # Most common drivers we want in desktop; less common are in o-p-extra
 * printer-driver-pnm2ppa       # several ppds require this
 * ghostscript-x
 * (hplip)     			# support for HP all-in-one printers
 * (printer-driver-min12xxw)	# support for KonicaMinolta PagePro 1200W, 1300W printers
 * (printer-driver-foo2zjs)	# support for printing to ZjStream-based printers
 * (printer-driver-splix)	# support for Samsung lasers
 * (printer-driver-pxljr)	# support for HP Color lasers
 * (printer-driver-c2esp)       # support for Kodak injket printers
 * (printer-driver-ptouch)      # support for Brother P-touch printers
 * (printer-driver-sag-gdi)     # support for Rico Aficio SPxxxx printers
 * (printer-driver-brlaser)     # support for some Brother laser printers
 * (printer-driver-m2300w)      # support for the Minolta magicolor 2300W/24000W color laser printers

= GUI infrastructure =

Packages used for X preconfiguration are just Recommends; removing them after initial installation should be relatively safe.

 * (laptop-detect)

 * xorg                          # this includes xserver-xorg->xserver-xorg-{input|video}-* (no need to add specific drivers manually)
 * !linux-image-*                # xorg transitively depends on this, but this would pull in grub-pc; we handle that separately
 * xkb-data                      # XKB data now lives here
 * spice-vdagent                 # Better when run as a Spice VM, like with GNOME Boxes LP: #1200296

Fonts:

 * fonts-dejavu-core
 * (fonts-kacst-one)
 * (fonts-sil-padauk)
 * (fonts-noto-cjk)
 * (fonts-ubuntu)

= Common Packaging Framework Stuff =

 * (packagekit)

= Firmware updating support =

 * (fwupd)
 * (fwupd-signed)

= Other =

 * anacron # generally appropriate for desktops
 * (kerneloops-daemon) # watch for and allow reporting of kernel problems
 * (policykit-desktop-privileges) # passwordless disk/CPU speed/time operations for admins
 * language-selector-common # helps installer to work out which language-support packages to install
