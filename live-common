Ubiquity needs full filesystem support for the partitioner.

 * xfsprogs
 * jfsutils
 * hfsplus [powerpc]  # ColinWatson
 * reiserfsprogs
 * btrfs-tools
 * ntfs-3g
 * lvm2
 * dmraid

# workaround for a broken aufs/overlayfs (e. g. LP #587888); also needs
# cdimage change to use union=unionfs-fuse kernel parameter
# * unionfs-fuse

# * (bootchart) [!armel] # scheduled for removal before maverick beta

 * fwupd-signed #signed efi firmware updating executable, remove in ubiquity if !efi

 * mokutil [amd64] # Needed for EFI install with third-party drivers

== Germinate workarounds ==

 * wamerican  # iamerican Depends: ispell Recommends: wordlist, but wamerican isn't spotted in time so germinate arbitrarily picks miscfiles instead
