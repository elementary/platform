Task-Section: user
Task-Relevance: 9
Task-Description: Minimal base system
Task-Extended-Description: This task installs the core of an Ubuntu-based system.
Task-Test-new-install: install skip
Task-Seeds: required

Note that some packages that form the core of an Ubuntu-based system are in the required seed, from which this seed inherits. The minimal seed describes those packages at Priority: important.

Recommends are followed when processing this seed even though debootstrap doesn't do that. This may occasionally produce confusing results; however, it should be correct at release time, since the results of processing the seed are synced to Priority: important overrides.

= Hardware and Architecture Support =

== Generic ==

== ppc32, ppc64 ==

 * powerpc-utils [powerpc ppc64el] # ColinWatson

== Comfortable Unix System ==

Programs and packages necessary for both the proper functionality of the system and that any user would expect to find on a modern Unix-like system.

 * adduser
 * apt
 * apt-utils         # apt-extracttemplates is required for debconf preconfiguration
 * bzip2
 * console-setup     # https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/sane-installer-keyboard
 * debconf-i18n      # buildd chroots don't need this, but other systems generally do
 * kbd
 * eject             # very popular, useful, small
 * flatpak
 * initramfs-tools   # needed for the Ubuntu kernel
 * less
 * locales
 * lsb-release
 * kmod
 * netbase
 * python3           # explicitly seeded, despite lsb-release also pulling it it
 * (rsyslog)
 * sudo              # LaMontJones
 * sysvinit-utils    # until "pidof" moves into procps, Debian #810018
 * tzdata
 * ubuntu-advantage-tools # needs to be on the system by default for ESM
 * ubuntu-keyring     # for authenticated package downloads
 * udev
 * vim-tiny
 * whiptail          # for debconf's Dialog frontend

== Networking ==

These provide various networking services, all should be configured in a client-only state with the server de-activated unless the user requires it.

 * isc-dhcp-client   # LaMontJones
 * iproute2
 * nplan          # foundations-aa-migrating-to-neplan (replaces ifupdown)

 * iputils-ping
 * netcat-openbsd # FabioMassimoDiNitto

= Meta =

 * init               # ensure we have an init system (but minimal chroots)
 * elementary-minimal     # elementary-specific bits we want on every elementary system
